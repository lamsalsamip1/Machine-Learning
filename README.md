# Machine-Learning
A collection of my machine learning projects as I learn different algorithms.

## 1) Premier League Points Predictor - Linear Regression
This model takes input data of how many goals the team will score and predicts the number of points the team will obtain throughout the season. For this I scraped data of goals scored and points obtained from past 5 seasons and implemented a linear regression model from scratch without the use of a library.

## 2) Premier League Top 4 Predictor - Logistic Regression
This model takes input of total points obtained in season and tries to predict whether that team will finish top 4 and qualify for champions league or not. I collected sample data from past 5 seasons and created a logistic regression model from scratch without the use of library.

## 3) AI Covid Predictor using Neural Networks
This model takes input of over 20 questions to identify covid symptoms and predict the chance of having covid. Dataset was collected from Kaggle.

## 4) Customer Segmentation using K Means
This model uses the K means clustering algorithm to segment customers based on their spending. This was done on a mall dataset available in Kaggle.

## 5) Movie Recommendation System using Collaborative Filtering
I used the collaborative filtering algorithm to make a recommender system model using the Movie Lens dataset. I implemented the algorithm using Tensorflow according to Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Specialization course.
