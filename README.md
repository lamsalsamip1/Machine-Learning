# Machine-Learning
A collection of my machine learning projects as I learn.

## 1) Premier League Points Predictor - Linear Regression
This model takes input data of how many goals the team will score and predicts the number of points the team will obtain throughout the season. For this I scraped data of goals scored and points obtained from past 5 seasons and implemented a linear regression model from scratch without use of library.

## 2) Premier League Top 4 Predictor - Logistic Regression
This model takes input of total points obtained in season and tries to predict whether that team will finish top 4 and qualify for champions league or not. I collected sample data from past 5 seasons and created a logistic regression model from scratch without use of library.
